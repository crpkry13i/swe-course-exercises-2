- What are some differences between client side and server side routing?
  The client side routing is the routing that occurs on the client side of the application. The server side routing is the routing that occurs on the server side of the application. The client side routing is used to navigate between pages and the server side routing is used to handle the routing of the application.

- What are two ways of handling redirects with React Router? When would you use each?
  The first way of handling redirects with React Router is to use the `<Redirect>` component. This component is used to redirect the user to a different page. The second way of handling redirects with React Router is to use the `<Link>` component. This component is used to link to a different page. Another way of handling redirects with React Router is to use the `<Route>` component. This component is used to handle the routing of the application.

- What are two different ways to handle page-not-found user experiences using React Router?

- How do you grab URL parameters from within a component using React Router?
  You can grab URL parameters from within a component using the `match` object. The `match` object is an object that contains information about the current route. The `match` object has a property called `params` that contains the URL parameters.

- What is context in React? When would you use it?

  The first problem that hooks were designed to solve was the problem of re-rendering. The second problem was the problem of state management. The third problem was the problem of data fetching. The fourth problem was the problem of asynchronous code. The fifth problem was the problem of performance. The sixth problem was the problem of code organization. The seventh problem was the problem of code reusability. Eighth problem was the problem of code maintainability.
