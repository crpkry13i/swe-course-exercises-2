### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
  A JWT is a JSON Web Token. It is a JSON object that contains a payload and a signature. The payload is the data that is encrypted and the signature is the data that is used to verify the data. The payload is encrypted with a secret key and the signature is encrypted with a public key. The public key is used to verify the signature. The secret key is used to decrypt the payload.

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
  The signature is used to verify the payload. It is used to verify that the payload has not been tampered with.

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
  No. The payload is encrypted with a secret key. The secret key is not known to the attacker.

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
  The JWT is sent in the Authorization header. The Authorization header is a string that contains the JWT. The JWT is encrypted with a secret key. The secret key is not known to the attacker. The JWT is decrypted with a public key. The public key is used to verify the signature.

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
  Unit tests are tests that are run on a single piece of code. Integration tests are tests that are run on a larger piece of code. End-to-end tests are tests that are run on a whole application.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
  A mock is a fake object that is used to test a real object.

- What is continuous integration?
  Continuous integration is a process that runs tests on a code base and makes sure that the tests pass.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
  An environment variable is a variable that is set in the environment. The environment is the set of variables that are set when the program is run.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
  TDD is a software development process that focuses on writing tests before writing code. The benefits of TDD are:
  - It helps to find bugs early.
  - It helps to find bugs more quickly.
  - It helps to find bugs more accurately.
  The drawbacks of TDD are:
  - It makes the code more complex.
  - It makes the code harder to read.
  - It makes the code harder to maintain.

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
  JSONSchema is a JSON schema that is used to validate JSON. It is a standard that is used to validate JSON.

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
  The code that is most likely to break. The code that is most likely to be used.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
  RETURNING is used to return the values of the columns that are being updated.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
  Web Sockets are a way to communicate between two computers. HTTP is a way to send and receive data over the internet.

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
  I prefer using Express because it is more popular and I am more familiar with it.
