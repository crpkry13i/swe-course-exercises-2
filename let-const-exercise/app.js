var has function scope rules whereas const has block scope rules. Variables with var can be reassigned, can be redeclared and can mutate. Whereas variables with const cannot be reassinged or redeclared.

The difference between let and const is with let you can reassign and mutate variables. const is unable to reassign and redeclare. const is meant to keep initial variables constant, however const can mutate.

Hoisting is a process where JavaScript metaphroically moves var declarations to the top of the script and is run first The variable will return undefined. let and const have no hoisting ability and will return a reference error.
