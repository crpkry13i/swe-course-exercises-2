"""Print each square on a new line.

A simple square will only be one line::

    >>> dump(0)
    0

    >>> dump(1)
    1

A split square will use four lines::

    >>> dump([0, 1, 0, 1])
    0
    1
    0
    1

A nested split square will use one line per square::

    >>> dump([0, 0, 0, [1, 1, 1, 1]])
    0
    0
    0
    1
    1
    1
    1

Of course, these can nested deeply and still work::

    >>> dump([0, 0, 0, [1, 1, 1, [0, 0, 0, [1, 1, 1, 1]]]])
    0
    0
    0
    1
    1
    1
    0
    0
    0
    1
    1
    1
    1
