# Big-O Notation Practice

In this exercise, youâ€™ll analyze expressions and code to figure out the time complexity.

Step One: Simplifying Expressions
Simplify the following big O expressions as much as possible:

1. O(n + 10) = 0(n)
2. O(100*n) = 0(n)
3. O(25) = 0(1)
4. O(n^2 + n^3) = 0(n^3)
5. O(n + n + n + n) = 0(n)
6. O(1000*log(n) + n) = 0(n)
7. O(1000*n*log(n) + n) = 0(n log n)
8. O(2^n + n^2) = 0(2^n)
9. O(5 + 3 + 1) = 0(1)
10. O(n + n^(1/2) + n^2 + n * log(n)^10) = 0(n^2)
