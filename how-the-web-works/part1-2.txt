PART ONE

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules between how browsers and servers communicate.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is an address given to an unique resource on the web.

DNS (Domain Name System). It’s function is to give IP addresses domain names so that users can connect to websites without having to type it’s IP addresses and instead type it’s domain name.

Query String is part of the URL that assigns values to specified parameters to recover specific information from a database.

HTTP verbs GET and POST. GET requests without side effects. POST requests with side effects.

An HTTP request is a message that is sent by a client to a server.

An HTTP response is the packet of information sent by the server to the client.

HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. Example: Accept-Language, Content-Type.

The protocol HTTP is being used. “somesite.com” is seen as an IP address with port 80 as the default for HTTP and that’s sent to the server. “/some/page.html” is the resource it’s asking to GET. Server sends HTML with response code. Browser makes a DOM from HTML, finds other resources and makes separate HTTP requests for other resources and receives responses from the server.
